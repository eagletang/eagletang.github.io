You also asked for a short history of RasMol.

I did my first degree at Imperial Collge, Univeristy of London.  I spent 
my first summer working there working in the Computer Graphics section
preparing images for a text book they were writing on the subject, 
published by Addison Wesley.  Because of this work, i.e. I'd written the 
questions in the course text, I was advised not to do computer graphics 
as one of my final year options, but instead choose to work on parallel 
and distributed programming.

It was about this time, 1989, that I met some crystallographers, in the 
Biophysics Department at Imperial.  Their original "vector" based Evans 
& Sutherland PS300 displays were being replaced with new Silcon Graphics 
workstations.  Biochemistry was shifting its emphesis from bonds and 
connectivity to surfaces and interactions.  This resulted in a loss of 
depth information from the depth-cued (hither-and-yon) that was available 
with vectors and dots.  The two possible ways of increasing depth 
perception was to add shadowing from a light source and allow images to 
be manipulated in real-time.  At that time these were mutually exclusive, 
some of the images that I'd generated two years earlier had taken 9 hours 
to generate with shadows.

This seemed to perfect final year parallel programming project. Spheres 
were the easiest graphical object to draw, and hopefully the parallel 
machines available at the time would achieve some speed-up on the 
problem. Hence the birth of RasMol, for shadowed RASter MOLecules (the 
fact that RAS are my initials was probably conincidental :).

My final year project "Parallel Algorithms for Molecular Graphics" was 
then spent comparing different algorithms for speeding up ray-tracing on 
parallel computers.  When I finished I'd won the University of London 
prize and had the second fastest program in the world for displaying 
shadows on spacefilling molecules.  The fastest at this time was an 
implementation of Raster3D running on the 800 processor Edinburgh 
Parallel Supercomputer.

For completely, different reasons I did my PhD in the Computer Science 
department at the University of Edinburgh, studying the ways that 
programs could automatically be made more efficient.  While there I met 
Dr Andrew Coulson, the mentor of RasMol, in the Biocomputing Research 
Unit.  I discovered that the improvements that made Raster3D go faster 
could also be applied to RasMol.  Slowly, in my spare time, RasMol with 
and without shadows, got faster and faster on a parallel computer untill 
the communication between computers became a significant problem. At
first the maximum performance was on 16 processors, then 12, then 8, then 
4 and finally I decided to port it to a UNIX workstation.

At this time, RasMol when run would only pop up a picture of crambin, 
rotate it 20 times, stop and print out how long it had taken.

At this point Andrew said wouldn't it be nice to change the colours of 
the atoms, wouldn't it be nice to display a wireframe model. This went on 
for another four years, my knowledge of protein structure completely 
demand driven.  I'd just be given a recent paper on hydrogen bonding in 
proteins and asked to see if RasMol could be made to implement it. By 
the time, I came to complete my PhD RasMol was already being used in four 
departments within the University of Edinburgh.

As a parting gesture, I made RasMol (UNIX and PC) public domain and placed 
it on the internet in June 1993.  And once again the requests started 
over...  Although RasMol was public domain, version 2.0 included a line 
to the effect "if you find this software useful, please send $40 to me".
However, the first two cheques I received were from a childrens hospital 
and a neurology department at a genral hospital, yet several 
multinational corperations had taken copies of RasMol.  I sent the 
cheques back and never cashed them.  With the exception of version 2.6 
(due to be released soon), a new version of RasMol has been announced 
every four months.

In January 1994, I was offered a temporary (2 month) position at Glaxo 
Research and Development.  Glaxo admitted that it made large use of 
RasMol, but had no mechanism for paying for RasMol accept giving me 
money to work on RasMol there.  Until then I'd been scraping a living a 
a research assistant/lab demonstrator in Edinburgh. This "temporary" 
arrangement has lasted a year and a half, allowing me access to a 
(bio)chemistry oriented user-group and provided the funding for me to 
develop a Apple Mac version at Glaxo Research Inc in the US.

RasMol is probably one of the most widely used molecular graphics 
programs in the world, currently being used at over 10,000 sites.
For example, the French Education Ministry will shortly distribute 
RasMol to every univeristy, secondary school and teacher training college 
in France.  In addition to both English and French, the RasMol user 
manual has also been translated into Thai.  RasMol is very heavily used 
in under-developed countries were universities can't afford the high 
prices of commercial software packages.

I hope this provides some insight.  You might want to display a short 
extract from one of RasMol's ChangeLog files that lists the continual
evolution of RasMol thanks to bug reports, suggestions and improvements 
provided by the community.

As you now realise, I have had no (very little) formal biochemistry or 
molecular biology training, and much of what I know has been a result of 
conversations and e-mails with people much brighter than I.  For example, 
Andrew Coulson was been very patient in explaining why handedness was 
important.  In computer graphics, it doesn't matter whether the z-axis 
goes into or out from the screen.  Similarly, I once knocked on his door 
and explained that I couldn't find the second chain in a PDB file of a 
tRNA when I was trying to determine nucleic acid hydrogen bonding.  It 
was even Stryer (of text book fame) who first suggested a pause command.
Some of the improvements in RasMol were suggested by David Richardson,
Mage's author, while I was over in North Carolina.

Hence the real credit for RasMol is from the user community that have 
provided the feedback on how it can be further improved.  My single 
contribution is a little used menu item on the options menu.

In 1966, Cyrus Levinthal pioneered molecular graphics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, when he set up the first interactive wire-frame display of a protein on a monochrome oscilloscope (Levinthal, 1966). Since then, molecular graphics has made tremendous progress, mostly thanks to the video game industry, which induced the rise of graphics processing units (GPUs). Today many different molecular visualizers are available, e.g. VMD (Humphrey et al., 1996), Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004), PyMol (DeLano, 2005) or QuteMol (Tarini et al., 2006), each using different tricks to boost rendering performance and quality. We describe an algorithm that can cope with two specific difficulties: first, it does not depend on high-end shader tricks and thus works on smartphones too. And second, it does not require expensive precalculation steps that depend on atom positions. It can thus visualize moving atoms, allowing to perform interactive molecular dynamics simulations on smartphones and tablets.

History

Initially the rendering was on early Cathode ray tube screens or through plotters drawing on paper. Molecular structures have always been an attractive choice for developing new computer graphics tools, since the input data are easy to create and the results are usually highly appealing. The first example of MG was a display of a protein molecule (Project MAC, 1966) by Cyrus Levinthal and Robert Langridge. Among the milestones in high-performance MG was the work of Nelson Max in "realistic" rendering of macromolecules using reflecting spheres.

By about 1980 many laboratories both in academia and industry had recognized the power of the computer to analyse and predict the properties of molecules, especially in materials science and the pharmaceutical industry. The discipline was often called "molecular graphics" and in 1982 a group of academics and industrialists in the UK set up the Molecular Graphics Society (MGS). Initially much of the technology concentrated either on high-performance 3D graphics, including interactive rotation or 3D rendering of atoms as spheres (sometimes with radiosity). During the 1980s a number of programs for calculating molecular properties (such as molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics) became available and the term "molecular graphics" often included these. As a result the MGS has now changed its name to the Molecular Graphics and Modelling Society (MGMS).

The requirements of macromolecular crystallography also drove MG because the traditional techniques of physical model-building could not scale. Alwyn Jones' FRODO program (and later "O") were developed to overlay the molecular electron density determined from X-ray crystallography and the hypothetical molecular structure.
