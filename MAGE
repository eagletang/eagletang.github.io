https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinemage
Kinemages were first developed by David Richardson at Duke University School of Medicine, for the Protein Society's journal Protein Science that premiered in January 1992.[2] For its first 5 years (1992â€“1996), each issue of Protein Science included a supplement on floppy disk of interactive, 3D kinemage graphics to illustrate many of the articles, plus the Mage software (free, open source, multi-platform) to display them;[3] kinemage supplementary material is still available on the journal web site. Mage and RasMol[4] were the first widely used macromolecular graphics programs to support interactive display on personal computers. Kinemages are used for teaching[5][6] and for textbook supplements,[7][8] as well as individual exploration and analysis of macromolecular structures.
