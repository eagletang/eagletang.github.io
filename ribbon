Ribbons

Protein and nucleic acid chains can be shown with ribbons. Protein helix and strand assignments are taken from the input structure file or generated with ksdssp. For nucleic acids, the ribbon simply follows the backbone.

flat ribbon	edged ribbon	rounded ribbon
The built-in ribbon styles are:

flat
edged
rounded
Ribbon segments for individual residues can be shown and hidden independently and displayed in different styles. New styles (cross-section shape and smoothing), scalings (width and height), and residue classes (defined by which atoms guide the ribbon path) can be created using Ribbon Style Editor.
The command ribbon displays ribbons, ribrepr sets which ribbon style is shown, and ribscale sets which scaling is applied. Ribbon display and style can also be controlled with the Actions menu; residue ribbon display, style, and scaling can be controlled in the molecule model attributes panel and the Selection Inspector.

Protein secondary structure can also be shown with PipesAndPlanks, and special representations of the base and sugar components of nucleic acids (combined with stick atoms/bonds in the figure) can be generated with the Nucleotides tool.

The pipes-and-planks and special nucleotide representations are VRML objects and can only be displayed/undisplayed as a whole.

Molecular representations

Each loaded structure can be displayed using a variety of representations that can be combined to create complex molecular views. Multiple representation types are supported, including space-filling spheres for atoms (spacefill), cylinders and spheres for bonds and atoms (ball+stick), simple lines for bonds (line), secondary structure abstraction (cartoon), backbone atom trace (backbone). The appearance of the representations can be fine-tuned by parameters, for example, to change the quality. Most representations have a color and a radius parameter that can use data from the underlying structure. For instance, a representation can be colored uniformly or according to the element, residue or secondary structure type of the atoms from which the representation is derived. The size of representation objects, for example sphere and cylinder radii in a ball+stick representation, can be set similarly.

The parameters can be set from the representation menu in the user interface or via the API of the representation component class.

Common parameters

assembly: List of various assemblies, either automatically created or given in the structure file. Included are the asymmetric unit (AU) corresponding to the coordinates given in the structure file, biological assemblies from PDB or mmCIF files (BU1, BU2, ...), a filled (crystallographic) unitcell of a given space group (UNITCELL), a supercell consisting of a center unitcell and its 26 direct neighbors (SUPERCELL). The default value is the first biological assembly or if that is not available the asymmetric unit.
flatShaded: A boolean value, when set to true non-ray-casted representations are flatly shaded such that individual triangles are discernible.
nearClip: A boolean value, by default true, but when set to false the representation is not clipped by the global near clipping plane.
opacity: A number between 1.0 and 0.0, where 1.0 means no transparency and 0.0 full transparency. Note that the transparent parameter must be set to true for it to work properly.
radius: A number providing a fixed radius used for rendering the representation.
radiusType: A list of possible sources of the radius used for rendering the representation. The radius can be based on the vdW radius, the covalent radius or the B-factor value of the corresponding atom. Additionally the radius can be based on the secondary structure. Alternatively, when set to size, the value from the radius parameter is used for all atoms.
scale: A number that scales the value defined by the radius or the radiusType parameter.
side: A list of values determining which side of the representation geometry is rendered. Either only the front is drawn (front), or only the back (back) or both sides (double).
transparent: A boolean value, either set to true, allowing transparency, or to false. Needs to be set to true for the opacity parameter to work properly.

Cartoon

The `Cartoon' option produces a simplified representation of a protein based on its secondary structure. Helices are drawn as cylinders, beta sheets as solid ribbons, and all other structures (coils and turns) as a tube. If the secondary structure has not yet been determined, it will be calculated automatically by the program STRIDE.
A helix cylinder is constructed by finding the least squares linear fit along the coordinates of the helix's C${}_\alpha$ atoms. If a given residue's C${}_\alpha$ is selected, the small cylinder (found by linear interpolation along the line of best fit) is drawn with radius determined by the ??? parameter. Because this method computes a best fit, a helix must have at least 3 residues before it is drawn (those helicies with one or two residues are drawn as a coil). It is possible to pick the C${}_\alpha$ for each cylinder segment, but they are at the location of the C${}_\alpha$, which is not near the axis cylinder. Interesting results occur when the whole protein is defined to be a helix and drawn as a cartoon.

The solid beta ribbon is constructed by building a spline along the center points between each beta sheet residue. Again, the spline is linearly interpolated to find the start and end points for each residue. Those are extended to construct the corners for a ribbon with rectangular cross section (the amount of extension is determined with the ??? parameter). A ribbon segment is used if the corresponding C${}_\alpha$ atom is selected. Note that since this method assumes the protein is in a beta conformation, it draws a much smoother ribbon than the standard Ribbon option, which draw the ribbon with an oscillation along the sheet.

The other conformations are drawn as a tube. Since the endpoints of the helix cylinder and cartoon sheet are not at the C${}_\alpha$ coordinate, the tube method was slightly changed to make the tube go to the new locations. This does not always work, resulting in a tube which does not quite connect to a cylinder.

Other visual representations of molecules include:
Lines
Sticks
Spheres
Surface / Mesh / Dots
Ribbon / Cartoon
These are summarized in the PyMOL screenshot below:


Each visualization has its pros and cons, which usually focus on finding a balance between easily identifying structure/function and being faithful to the underlying physics. 

The surface/mesh usually represent some distance-based threshold which is a rough approximation the electron cloud, or the reach of the molecule's interactions. However, the surface usually obscures the internal structure of the molecules. 

A stick representation does not show the extent of the electron clouds, but is more see-through (so you can see the internal structure), and also bond angles can be seen more clearly. 

A ribbon/cartoon abstracts away the atoms so that only large-scale structure is shown with specific emphasis on functional groups (e.g. the atoms with stick representations in the picture posted in the question). In proteins, these large-scale structures could include Alpha Helices or Beta Sheets, which define the secondary structure of the protein.

Here's a high-quality comparison between a ribbon and mesh visualization of a large protein: (from @Cap binding and immune evasion revealed by Lassa nucleoprotein structure : Nature : Nature Publishing Group)



The ribbon visualization is clearly superior in understanding the function/structure of this protein, while the mesh is more physically accurate, and also shows information of charge density (red and blue representing positively and negatively charged regions)
