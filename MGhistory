Historical Context

Pictures help in understanding the structure and function of biologically significant molecules. When individual atoms and bonds are being considered, representations of bonds as sticks and atoms as balls or as ellipsoids showing thermal librations are commonly used. When structure on a larger scale is being considered, renderings based on stick bonds without explicit representations of atoms, spaced-filling balls for atoms without explicit representations of bonds, ribbons and curved tubes to represent polymeric backbones and isoparametric surfaces coloured by the state of other parameters are commonly used. On either scale, electron density maps are useful. The small scale renderings were standardized in 1965 when Carroll Johnson1 created the Oak Ridge Thermal Ellipsoid Program, ORTEP, a computer program that renders atoms as balls or ellipsoids connected by stick bonds. Cyrus Levinthal and Robert Langridge2 used computer graphics for larger scale renderings in structural biology. In 1969, Irving Geis3 set the standard for hand-drawn, graphical renderings of the features of biological macromolecules. In the 1960's and 1970's computer generated graphics gradually caught up with the standard set by Geis. See the F. Scott Mathews 1983 review4. High quality graphical representations of molecules became an essential element of scientific research in structural biology. In 1991, Kraulis5 released Molscript, which, in combination with Raster3D6, has become the standard for high-quality renderings of macromolecules as static images. In 1992, the Richardsons released a Macintosh-based visualization program for kinemages7 of macromolecules. In 1992, Roger Sayle8 described the program RasMol, which used a highly efficient rendering algorithm to allow high quality interactive rendering of macromolecules on a wide variety of platforms. The program was released in 1993. Roger Sayle's maintenance and development of RasMol was supported by Glaxo for several years.

There are many other graphic rendering programs in use in structural biology. Swiss-PdbViewer9 displays and manipulates multiple models and electron density maps. Raster3D6,10,11 provides a powerful set of rendering tools for quality images of ribbons, space-filling atoms, etc. Molscript1213 is a rendering program both for visualisation and export to other rendering programs, such as Raster3D. Molecular Simulations Inc. (MSI) distributes WebLab ViewerLite for free and sells WebLab ViewerPro for visualisation of molecules on Macs and PCs (see http://www.msi.com/life/products/weblab/viewer). MDL Information Systems, Inc (MDL) distributes Chemscape Chime, a derivative of RasMol that works as a web browser "plug-in". In the late 1980's UCSF Computer Graphics Laboratory's MIDAS 13 provided graphics tools for drug design by visualisation and docking of molecules. In the early 1990's Anthony Nicholls' GRASP14 brought a new level of rigor and quality to visualisation of surfaces.

Many of the programs mentioned in an historical context above have continued to develop. Ortep is alive and well with a new user-friendly semi-interactive interface (see http://www.ornl.gov/ortep). The current descendant of MIDAS is Chimera (see http://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera), which emphasizes extensibility. GRASP has been made highly accessible by a web server (GRASS, see http://trantor.bioc.columbia.edu/GRASS/surfserv_enter.cgi). For pointers to additional rendering programs, see the RCSB web page (http://www.rcsb.org), and the IUCr web page (http://www.iucr.org).
