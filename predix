The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to smart machine-to-machine (M2M) interconnection technology enabled by secure connectivity and appropriate infrastructure, to reliably transform data into useful information for people, businesses, and institutions with appropriate analytics. The appropriate infrastructure could be a hybrid compute and store mechanisms like cloud stack and BigData technologies.
 Lots of IoT frameworks and/or platforms with different enterprise offerings and alliances have come up recently to increase the connectivity of devices into private and/or public networks/cloud. Key to a successful IoT implementation is the interoperability among various devices, robust IoT Frameworks and platforms that enable the same with a powerful analytics that enable applications to be built on top of it. Additionally these platform also need to provide value added services that increase the attractiveness for adoption of their solutions in enterprises.
 This is an effort to capture details of various platforms that enable IoT and the standards efforts to increase interoperability among the devices.

IoT Frameworks And Platforms: 
 Basic components of IoT Value Chain as highlighted below in Figure 1 are part of the offerings that are provided by various players in this space. Due to the evolution of these platforms the composition of features offered varies and over period of time may converge into these architectural blocks.

IoT platforms evolved from two different directions. Those providing Devices and their connectivity solutions in private networks moved to the internet/public cloud. Other approach was the cloud provider’s added IoT protocols and application support to enhance the reach of their platform to multiple industries. Here below are the different framework and platform providers that are prevalent in the industry.
IoT Providers With Cloud Connectivity: 

RTI: RTI is one of the oldest and pioneer Internet of Things Platform provider, they claim to be the Most Influential Industrial IoT Company.

They provide SDK that can enable writing applications that connect devices all the way up to hosting the data and writing applications that can utilize the data for workflow and analytics.

Azure IoT: Azure IoT Suite is an offering from Microsoft designed to get customers started quickly and realize business value from IoT. It can be up and running with a fully functional pre-configured solution in a matter of minutes and can provide a set of ‘virtual devices’ that run in the cloud to visualize the entire solution working end to end without having to connect a physical device!. Azure IoT Suite also takes care of the tasks of deploying and orchestrating the various services to give a complete end to end solution. Azure IoT device SDK, is an open source set of client libraries that run on a variety of operating systems and devices. SDK also provides step by step guidance and sample code that makes it easy to build prototypes with real devices that interact with the Azure IoT Suite.
